#[PatridgeDev.com](http://www.patridgedev.com/) MonoDevelop Settings

This repo is here entirely for my own use, but feel free to use it as you want.

I've made quite a few keyboard shortcuts to make my Mac MonoDevelop experience mirror Visual Studio. Since it was just as easily to source-control the entire settings directory, it is all included. If I tweak any templates (current ones are all defaults), they will join the repo.

##License

MIT license. If you do something cool with it, though, I'd love to hear about it.
