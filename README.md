#[PatridgeDev.com](http://www.patridgedev.com/) MonoDevelop Settings

This repo is here entirely for my own use, but feel free to use it as you want.

I've made quite a few keyboard shortcuts to make my Mac MonoDevelop experience mirror Visual Studio. Since it was just as easily to source-control the entire settings directory, it is all included. If I tweak any templates (current ones are all defaults), they will join the repo.

##Highlights

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>,<kbd>O</kbd> - "Show Definitions Only"
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>,<kbd>M</kbd> - "Toggle Fold"
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>,<kbd>C</kbd> - "Toggle Line Comment(s)" (NOTE: Puts `//` at line start instead of non-whitespace start. MonoDevelop's default of <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> isn't bad, just not what I use.)
* <kbd>F5</kbd> - Start Debugging
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> - Stop
* <kbd>F10</kbd> - "Step Over"
* <kbd>F11</kbd> - "Step Into"
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd> - "Step Out"
* <kbd>F9</kbd> - "Toggle Breakpoint"

MIT license. If you do something cool with it, though, I'd love to hear about it.
